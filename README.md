# Kaggle Challenge: TItanic Survival Prediction

## **_In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)._**

### MetaData

    - PassengerId = Passenger ID
    - Survived = Weather Survived or not: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
    - Pclass = Ticket class: 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
    - Name = Name of the Passenger
    - Sex = Gender
    - Age = Age in Years
    - SibSp = No. of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
    - Parch = No. of parents / children aboard the Titanic
    - Ticket = Ticket number
    - Fare = Passenger fare
